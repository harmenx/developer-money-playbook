# QUICK START: Developer Money Playbook

This guide gives you the fastest route to increasing your income, building passive revenue, and leveraging your developer skills. Skip fluff — focus on action.

---

## 1. Assess Your Skills & Leverage
- List your top 3–5 technical skills (languages, frameworks, AI, automation).  
- Identify high-paying opportunities for each skill (freelance, consulting, SaaS, AI tools).  
- Ask: *Which skill can make me $100/day in 1 month? $1,000/day in 6–12 months?*

---

## 2. Income Streams (High Impact)
Focus on a mix of **active and passive income**:

**Active:**
- Freelancing / contracting on Upwork, Toptal, or remote job boards.  
- Consulting for startups or small businesses.  
- High-ticket digital products (SaaS tools, apps, templates).

**Passive:**
- Build simple apps or SaaS with recurring revenue.  
- Content creation (YouTube, UGC, tutorials, newsletters).  
- Affiliate marketing for developer tools or platforms.  
- White-label / resell scripts, templates, or mini software products.

## 3. Rapid Execution Strategy
1. Pick **one active** and **one passive** stream to start immediately.  
2. Set measurable goals (e.g., $500/month from passive in 60 days).  
3. Automate everything you can: deployment, marketing, tracking, invoicing.  
4. Iterate fast — if a strategy doesn’t work in 2–4 weeks, pivot.

## 4. Tools & Automation
- **Productivity:** Notion, Obsidian, Todoist.  
- **Income Tracking:** Airtable, Google Sheets, or a simple Notion dashboard.  
- **Automation:** Zapier, Make, scripts, GitHub Actions for deployment.
